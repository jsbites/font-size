## Installation

```bash
npm install -g font-size
```

## Usage

```bash
font-size --help #to get help

font-size --distance 28 --x-height .53 --resolution 110

    For your typeface, the minimum legible font size is 14px
        (you don’t want to hurt your eyes, do you?).

    Your text is nicely readable starting from… 16px;

    however, anything beyond 19px will damage readability.
```

Note: This is a quick-and-dirty hack that I put together; it is not %100 scientific, and the parameters will probably change from person to person. — I have tried to pick up sane defaults; feel free to fork the project and configure it to your needs.
